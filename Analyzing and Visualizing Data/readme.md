Sub-folder dedicated to the project for the Analyzing and Visualizing Data course.

In this project, we developed a Power BI report on Microsoft's stock performance. In addition to stock and company data collected through Alpha Vantage and Quandl APIs, and through SNL Financial, we collected news through News API and tweets containing the Microsoft stock ticker (typically in Twitter displayed as $MSFT) to perform sentiment analysis on news and tweets about the stock.
